# Purpose

This repository contains LaTeX templates for making DIY paper pads. Currently,
it contains templates for:

* [Grid sheets](grid)
* [Lined sheets](line)

These templates use my own default settings. The reason I am open-sourcing them
is so that you can customize them to your own needs. If you need help, please
feel free to open an issue and I will get to it as soon as I find time for this
project.

# Unprintable Margins

If desired, you can use [`unprintable-margins.tex`](unprintable-margins.tex) to
accurately measure the unprintable margins of your printer. See the comment
inside that file for instructions. (Click
