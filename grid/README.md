# Introduction

The files in this directory define multiple types of grid templates. Each
template is defined by three files:

1. `paper-printer.tex`, which defines the parameters related to the target paper
   type (e.g., a4 vs. letter, landscape vs. portrait) and the production printer
   (e.g., unprintable margins).

2. A main file named after the template, which defines the template parameters.

3. `body.tex`, which typesets the template into a one-page PDF.
