% !TeX root = ./unprintable-margins.tex

% The purpose of this document is to help us measure the unprintable margins of
% a printer. This document prints four special isosceles triangles pointing at
% the four paper borders with a deliberate zero margin. These triangles are
% designed to have identical heights and bases; therefore, the base of an
% unprinted tip should have the same length as the unprintable (and thus
% unprinted) margin of the corresponding border. This equality often does *not*
% hold, however, due to the mechanical inaccuracy in paper feeding, which
% differs from sheet to sheet. Since it is difficult to account for the
% feed-induced offset of a test print, we should not rely on the measurements of
% the unprinted margins of a single test print. Fortunately, a single test print
% is still sufficient for our purpose because we can deduce the unprintable
% margin of each border by simply measuring the width of the base of the
% corresponding unprinted tip.
